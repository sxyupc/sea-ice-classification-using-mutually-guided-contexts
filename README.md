This is the implementation code for the method proposed in the paper on Sea Ice Classification Using Mutually Guided Contexts.
We mainly use the MATLAB version code for experiments, and the Python version of the code is a cross version extension based on the MATLAB version of the code. The Python version of the code may differ from the results obtained in the MATLAB version, please understand.
For the MATLAB and Python versions of the code, please run main.m and main.py to obtain the results, respectively.
If our research or code can help your study, please cite our paper.
