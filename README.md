This is the implementation code for the method proposed in the paper on Sea Ice Classification Using Mutually Guided Contexts.
We mainly use MATLAB version code for experiments, and the Python version code is an extension we have made.
For the MATLAB and Python versions of the code, please run main.m and main.py to obtain the results, respectively.
